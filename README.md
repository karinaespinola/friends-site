# Friends Site
This is a personal project in which a small site dedicated to one of my favorite TV shows FRIENDS. The idea of this site is to have a gallery with a picture of the characters and when the user clicks on any character then a quote from that character will be displayed on screen. So everytime the photo is clicked a new quote is displayed. The idea is pretty simple. The quotes are coming from another project of mine that you can find on this account here: [friends-api](https://github.com/karinaespinola/friends-api) and it's a pretty simple API with Node.js and mongoDB and actually it's already live on Heroku. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
